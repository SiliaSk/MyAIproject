# Predicting the most suitable cure for individuals with mental disorders with AI 

Final project for the Building AI course 

## A lot of people face difficulties with finding the appropriate medicine right away. As we know, treatment effectiveness may differ between patients, many times resulting in feelings of anxiety, exhaustion and depression. What if AI could uncover a solution to save both time and troubles?
 


## Background
The main problem this idea solves is the emotional weariness which individuals must undergo in order to reach the desired result. Moreover, they can simultaneously conserve both time and money. Unfortunately, this is a very real problem that people frequently deal with. Having people close to me who struggle with some kind of mental illness, I took the initiative for an idea that could provide them relief, bypassing the lengthy process of changing treatments until finding the most effective one. Applying artificial intelligence to mental health can be very convoluted, the lack of variety and broadness, may deliver unsatisfactory results. Until now, humanity has not yet found answers to many questions in this field. Consequently, due to insufficient data, AI intervention appears challenging. However, with small steps and by approaching more relatively simple problems like this, significant change could be achieved. With the increasing number of people diagnosed with mental disorders in recent years, the integration of AI appears intriguing. 



## How is it used? 
The whole idea is to create a platform which depending on the individual's characteristics (genetic/ behavioral/ metabolic) and specific symptoms it could predict the most suitable medication from a selection list. Below there are some of the situations which this platform needed:
- Clinical Settings: Hospitals, clinics, and healthcare facilities, where there is an urgent need for guidance in the choice of treatment
- Diversity: Provide safe and effective medication for diverse people who face curtain ailments(diabetes, autoimmune and other chronic diseases)
- Improvement of medicines: Î’y having a large database available from various groups of people with side effects, pharmaceutical industries would be able to more easily identify the weaknesses of each medicine leading to its improvement
- Biomarker Identification: By leveraging real-world and large patient data, advanced analytics, and collaborative networks, the platform can accelerate the discovery of biomarkers that improve treatment outcomes and advance precision psychiatry initiatives (Biomarkers: Is a measurable indicator of some biological state or condition. Biomarkers are often measured and evaluated using blood, urine, or soft tissues to examine normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention)    

The users will be mainly psychiatrists as well as pharmaceutical industries. Acknowledging the ethical dimensions of the platform's utilization is really important.
Ethical considerations regarding patient privacy, consent, and responsible data use are paramount, particularly in the context of AI applications in healthcare.

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
