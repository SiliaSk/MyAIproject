# Predicting the most suitable cure for individuals with mental disorders with AI 

Final project for the Building AI course 

## A lot of people face difficulties with finding the appropriate medicine right away. As we know, treatment effectiveness may differ between patients, many times resulting in feelings of anxiety, exhaustion and depression. What if AI could uncover a solution to save both time and troubles?
 


## Background
The main problem this idea solves is the emotional weariness which individuals must undergo in order to reach the desired result. Moreover, they can simultaneously conserve both time and money. Unfortunately, this is a very real problem that people frequently deal with. Having people close to me who struggle with some kind of mental illness, I took the initiative for an idea that could provide them relief, bypassing the lengthy process of changing treatments until finding the most effective one. Applying artificial intelligence to mental health can be very convoluted, the lack of variety and broadness, may deliver unsatisfactory results. Until now, humanity has not yet found answers to many questions in this field. Consequently, due to insufficient data, AI intervention appears challenging. However, with small steps and by approaching more relatively simple problems like this, significant change could be achieved. With the increasing number of people diagnosed with mental disorders in recent years, the integration of AI appears intriguing. 



## How is it used? 
The whole idea is to create a platform which depending on the individual's characteristics (genetic/ behavioral/ metabolic) and specific symptoms it could predict the most suitable medication from a selection list. Below there are some of the situations which this platform needed:
- Clinical Settings: Hospitals, clinics, and healthcare facilities, where there is an urgent need for guidance in the choice of treatment
- Diversity: Provide safe and effective medication for diverse people who face curtain ailments(diabetes, autoimmune and other chronic diseases)
- Improvement of medicines: Î’y having a large database available from various groups of people with side effects, pharmaceutical industries would be able to more easily identify the weaknesses of each medicine leading to its improvement
- Biomarker Identification: By leveraging real-world and large patient data, advanced analytics, and collaborative networks, the platform can accelerate the discovery of biomarkers that improve treatment outcomes and advance precision psychiatry initiatives (Biomarkers: Is a measurable indicator of some biological state or condition. Biomarkers are often measured and evaluated using blood, urine, or soft tissues to examine normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention)    

The users will be mainly psychiatrists as well as pharmaceutical industries. Acknowledging the ethical dimensions of the platform's utilization is really important.
Ethical considerations regarding patient privacy, consent, and responsible data use are paramount, particularly in the context of AI applications in healthcare.

- Genetic factors play a pivotal role in mental health, influencing treatment response and prognosis. Understanding genetic predispositions enhances precision and efficacy in treatment recommendations

- Human Brain structure can provide valuable insights into individual differences in treatment response. Factors such as neural connectivity, neurochemistry, and structural abnormalities can influence how individuals respond to various interventions, including medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes




## Data sources and AI methods
It's really important to have a large and diverse sample size. Therefore, using two different methods for data collection to achieve the desired results would be more convenient. The first approach involves gathering data from hospitals, clinics, and research institutions. However, this method presents some challenges, such as obtaining consent from patients and ensuring data protection for individuals. Additionally, data collected from clinics and hospitals may be subject to selection bias, as certain patient populations may be overrepresented or underrepresented. This can impact the generalizability of research findings to broader populations. Hence, employing an additional method, such as self-selected sampling via questionnaires, could enhance the efficiency of data collection. In the second method, to ensure equality between samples and incorporate genetic factors into the study, researchers could collect blood samples at a laboratory. Regardless of the method used, full consent and privacy protection of the participants are crucial in both processes. 

AI Methods:
- Decision Trees: Decision trees are one of the most common methods used in medicine, including for predicting treatment outcomes and diagnosing various conditions. They offer several advantages that make them suitable for these kinds of problems. (Efficient predictions for small to medium-sized datasets)

- Neural Networks: Neural networks can efficiently learn complex patterns from large datasets, offering high flexibility and adaptability, making them suitable for predicting treatment outcomes in mental health with diverse and intricate patient data. (Efficient for large-sized datasets)

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques: NLP techniques play a crucial role in extracting valuable insights from unstructured text data, such as clinical notes, medical literature, and research articles. These insights provide valuable information about patients' conditions, symptoms, treatment histories, and responses to different interventions. (Efficient for large-sized datasets)





## Challenges

Every innovative AI venture brings inherent challenges that require addressing.

- The factors that contribute to the effectiveness of a pharmaceutical product are numerous and complex. Therefore, data collection will take time and attention to detail to be an accurate forecast.
- Working with large and complex datasets may increase the risk of overfitting.
- Accessing data could be difficult, especially when considering genetic and other biological factors. This is why there is a suggestion of using two different methods of collecting data.
